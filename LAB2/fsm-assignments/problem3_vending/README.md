# Vending Machine FSM - Mealy Implementation

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a vending machine finite state machine (FSM) using Mealy architecture. The machine accepts coins of denomination 5 and 10, dispenses a product when the total reaches or exceeds 20, and provides change when necessary.

## Design Specifications

### Requirements
- Product Price: 20 units
- Accepted Coins: 5 (coin=01) and 10 (coin=10)
- Dispensing Logic: When total ≥ 20, assert dispense=1 for 1 cycle
- Change Logic: If total = 25, assert chg5=1 for 1 cycle (return 5 units)
- Reset Behavior: Synchronous active-high reset
- Coin Input: Maximum one coin per clock cycle
- Invalid Coins: Ignore coin=11, treat coin=00 as idle


## Implementation Approach

### 1. Mealy Architecture Choice
- Outputs depend on both current state and inputs
- Faster response compared to Moore machines
- Output logic integrated with state transition logic
- Single-cycle pulse generation for dispense and change signals

### 2. State Encoding Strategy
verilog
parameter idle=2'b00, five=2'b01, ten=2'b10, fifteen=2'b11;

- 2-bit encoding for 4 states
- Direct correspondence with accumulated coin values (0, 5, 10, 15)
- Efficient hardware implementation

### 3. Output Generation Logic

#### Vending Machine FSM – Output Generation Logic

The machine accepts *coins of 5 units and 10 units*.  
The item costs *20 units*.

---

#### States
- *ten* → the user has inserted 10 units so far.  
- *fifteen* → the user has inserted 15 units so far.  
- Other states (like idle, five) exist, but here we are focusing on when the machine should *dispense an item and/or return change*. 
---

#### Outputs
- *dispense* → goes high (1) when the machine gives the item.  
- *chg5* → goes high (1) when the machine returns a change of 5 units.  

---

#### Mealy Outputs (Generated on Inputs + State)

At every *clock cycle, the outputs are checked and updated based on the **current state* and the *coin inserted*.

#### Default case:
At the start of every clock cycle, outputs are reset to 0  
(no dispense, no change).

---

#### Case 1: state = ten and coin = 10
- Total = 10 (previous) + 10 (new coin) = *20*  
- Item is *dispensed*.  
- *dispense = 1, chg5 = 0*  

---

#### Case 2: state = fifteen and coin = 5
- Total = 15 (previous) + 5 (new coin) = *20*  
- Item is *dispensed*.  
- *dispense = 1, chg5 = 0*  

---

#### Case 3: state = fifteen and coin = 10
- Total = 15 (previous) + 10 (new coin) = *25*  
- Item is *dispensed, but since the user paid extra, the machine also **returns 5 units as change*.  
- *dispense = 1, chg5 = 1*

### Module Interface
verilog
module vending_mealy(
    input  wire clk,        // Clock signal
    input  wire rst,        // Synchronous active-high reset
    input  wire [1:0] coin, // Coin input: 01=5, 10=10, 00=idle
    output reg  dispense,   // Product dispensing pulse
    output reg  chg5        // Change (5 units) pulse
    output wire [1:0] state_present
);



## Test Scenarios and Expected Behavior

### Exact Payment (Total = 20)

1. 5+5+10 = 20: dispense=1, chg5=0
2. 5+10+5 = 20: dispense=1, chg5=0
3. 10+5+5 = 20: dispense=1, chg5=0
4. 10+10 = 20: dispense=1, chg5=0


### Overpayment (Total = 25)
 15+10 = 25 : dispense=1, chg5=1 

### Underpayment Scenarios
- Single coin (5 or 10): No dispensing, FSM waits
- Total < 20: FSM accumulates coins

### Reset Behavior
- Mid-transaction reset: FSM returns to idle state
- Accumulated total lost: Fresh transaction starts

## Testbench 

### Comprehensive Test Coverage
- All valid coin combinations totaling 20
- Overpayment scenarios (total = 25)
- Underpayment scenarios
- Reset functionality during transactions
- Multiple consecutive transactions

### Waveform Analysis Points
From the provided waveforms, key observation points:

- Dispense Pulses: Single-cycle assertions when total ≥ 20
- Change Signal: Asserted only when total = 25
- State Transitions: Clean transitions between coin accumulation states
- Reset Recovery: Proper return to idle state on reset assertion


## Verification Results

### Expected Pulse Indices
Based on testbench scenarios:
- Dispense pulses: Generated at completion of each valid transaction (total ≥ 20)
- Change pulses: Generated only for overpayment scenarios (total = 25)
- State consistency: FSM returns to idle after each successful transaction

## Compile/Run/Visualize Steps

### Prerequisites
- iverilog (Icarus Verilog compiler)
- GTKWave (for waveform visualization)

### Step 1: Compile
iverilog -o sim vending_mealy.v tb_vending_mealy.v

### Step 2: Run Simulation
vvp sim

### Step 3: Visualize Waveforms
gtkwave dump.vcd

#### In GTKWave:
- Add signals: clk, rst, coin[1:0], dispense, chg5
- Add internal signals: state_present[1:0], state_next[1:0] for debugging
- Set time scale and observe the transaction patterns
